 select a source
 put all the neighbours in a prority queue bcoz we want to evaluate the node with minimum edge
 make a table containing the parent, minimum edge distance and the curr node
 put the src in the pq and take it out and then put its neighbours in the pq one by one then take out the the topmost <edgewt, ele> or the neighbour with the least edge wt 
 in the table in front of the ele(present in the curr node) if the present wt in the table is inf or greater than the edgewt then
 replace the wt with the edgewt and make a visited set and push the ele in the visited set 
 nowinsert the neighbour of theat cuee ele in the pq and repeat this process
